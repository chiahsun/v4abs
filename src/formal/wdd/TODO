1. Strictly speaking,
   
   We need use word level solver to determine the containment/implication relation between terms

   and then encode the relation as the stateConstraints into the final WDD term handle.

   e.g. 

   p1 = (x > 3)  
   p2 = (x > 2)

   word level (x > 3) => (x > 2)

   add constraint makeIply(p1, p2) when building BDD
